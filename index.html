      <p class = "para1"> I was born and raised in the small island of Guam on 1985.
        Throughout the years I have been exposed to a laid back
        family-oriented lifestyle.
      </p>

      <p class = "para2"> My parents moved from Korea post Vietnam War and started up a
        construction company as the opportunity presented itself due
        to the military build up at the time. They raised three kids (myself
        included), two boys and one girl.
      </p>

      <p class = "para3"> In 2003 I moved to Seattle to attend the University of
        Washington for my bachelors. And then back to Guam in 2008 after the recession
        hit and was unable to find a job. In 2012 I moved to Hawaii for opportunity, but
        while the sun and beaches were fun to enjoy I found my life stagnating.
        That is why I decided to join <base target="_blank"><a href="https://www.codefellows.org/">
        Code Fellows</a></base> for an opportunity to pursue a meaningful life time career.
      </p>

      <p class = "para4"> My goals are to become a <em>top-notch coder</em> through
        the help of <base target="_blank"><a href="https://www.codefellows.org/">Code Fellows</a>
        </base>and be able to make my folks proud of the career I've developed.
